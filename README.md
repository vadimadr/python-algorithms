Python algorithms
=================
This repository contains my implementation of some common algorithms. 
I made it to improve solving different computer science problems.
I will add more algorithms when I have time. 

Every solved problem is tested using pytest (or will be tested soon) and believed to be correct. The code may not contain all possible optimisations - I chose most canonical implementations. 
Sometimes I provide multiple solutions to the same problem. The code is written to be readable and portable to other imperative programming languages (C++, Java, etc)
that's why I don't use python specific features (except for tests) like complex slices, itertools module, and so on, but I use numpy for problems that require
array or matrix.

I will be glad If you tell me about found bugs or grammatical errors and typos or provide more test cases (even for problems that aren't implemented yet).
